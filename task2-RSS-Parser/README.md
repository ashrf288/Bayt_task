# RSS Parser



We need to implement a new web page OR desktop app that should:

- Read the jobs from bayt client RSS: (https://www.rotanacareers.com/live-bookmarks/all-rss.xml)

- Parse the fetched jobs to get the job titles.

- Draw the jobs in a list.

- Draw the jobs based on locations on google maps (you can choose javascript or any backend language)


## Notes:

- As an end-user, I should see all bayt jobs titles Vs location in a table.

- You are free to choose any programming language you write


## how to run the project


this project contain two folder
1- BackEnd folder
2- FrontEnd folder

You must download these two folders then run each of them to run the project in the browser

### BackEnd

The first thing you need to do is install the node_modules by running this command in the terminal

```
npm i
```

 Now you are ready to start the server by running this command in the terminal

```
npm start
```

### FrontEnd

The first thing you need to do is install the node_modules by running this command in the terminal

```
npm i
```

 Now you are ready to start the project running this command in the terminal

```
npm start
```

the browser should open automatically the App.
if that does not happen paste this link in your browser.
http://localhost:3000/


## notes 
**i did not include the `.env` file in the `.gitignore`**
